        As the North Carolina men's tennis team grows stronger, the value of
        having an experienced group of core players should not be taken lightly.
        The team's veterans act as role models for the younger ones and show the
        grit and determination needed to outperform top players and win
        championships.
      </p>
      <p>
        With years of experience on the team, upperclassmen know what is
        demanded of them to play in a top college tennis program and continue to
        deliver the best out of themselves.

    <div class="qanda-div">
      <p class="questions">
        What do you do with your life and where do you work?
      </p>
      <p class="answers">
        I am a first-year college student at UNC-Chapel Hill and I work at the
        university newspaper The Daily Tar Heel. I am a writer on the
        newspaper's sports desk.
      </p>
      <p class="questions">
        What types of articles do you write and for what sports?
      </p>
      <p class="answers">
        I joined the desk in January, so I don't get to cover the sports with
        the most press yet. For now, I've covered Women's Lacrosse, Softball,
        Men's adn Women's Tennis, and golf. The types of articles that I write
        are gamers and sides.
      </p>
      <p class="questions">What is a gamer?</p>
      <p class="answers">
        A gamer is an abbreviation of game report. These have a template that is
        universal to all sports the DTH offers and is fairly straight forwards.
        The categories in the template are "What Happened?", "Who Stood Out?",
        "When Was It Decided?" "Why does it matter?", and "When do they play
        next?". I need to get these out ten minutes after the game ends, and
        they are directed mostly to people who didn't watch the game but want an
        overview of what happened.
      </p>
      <p class="questions">What is a side?</p>
      <p class="answers">
        A side is a type of article that comes after the game ends. This is a
        more detailed and creative type of article than the gamer. The main
        objective of these types of articles is to write about an aspect of the
        game that stood out. These are harder to write than gamers and require
        more copyediting.
      </p>
      <p class="questions">How many hours a week do you work?</p>
      <p class="answers">
        My workload depends week by week. On top of the four college classes I
        am taking at UNC, I usually cover two games a week. For home games, I
        have more work because I need to go to the game and write a gamer and a
        side. For away games, I only write a gamer based off stats and other
        information available about the game. On average, I'd say I work 10-12
        hours a week.
      </p>
      <p class="questions">What work experience do you have?</p>
      <p class="answers">
        I do not have any work experience in the field of journalism. The DTH is
        my first job as a journalist. I do have experience as a varsity high
        school tennis player and part-time junior tennis coach.
      </p>
      <p class="questions">
        What are educational requirements to join the DTH?
      </p>
      <p class="answers">
        The main educational requirement is to be a UNC student with a major or
        interest in journalism. There is a lot of writing in this job and
        everyone working in any desk must be a good writer and must be familiar
        with the AP Style.
      </p>
      <p class="questions">
        What do you want to get out of your work experience at the DTH?
      </p>
      <p class="answers">
        My main goal as a DTH staffer is to gain experience and be more prepared
        for whatever opportunities I get once I graduate from college. It will
        be very valuable for me to have worked for almost four years at an
        established news organization once I graduate from UNC. I am very happy
        with what I do and love writing for the paper.
