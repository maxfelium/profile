      My name is Max Feliu and I am a student at UNC-Chapel Hill, from
      Barcelona, Spain. I have lived in Spain, England, and in the United States
      before starting college. In my experiences in the different countries I
      have lived in, I have developed a passion for different sports entities
      around the world. From my home soccer team of FC Barcelona to UNC sports,
      my connection to these teams has made me become a Media and Journalism
      major and pursue a career as a journalist. I currently work as a sports
      writer for The Daily Tar Heel. With my work at the DTH, I get the
      opportunity to publish articles in a recognized newspaper while expanding
      my skills as a journalist. In the future, my dream is to return to my home
      country and report on sports in Spanish.
