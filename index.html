          My name is Max Feliu and I am a student at UNC-Chapel Hill, from
          Barcelona, Spain. I have lived in Spain, England, and in the United
          States before starting college. In my experiences in the different
          countries I have lived in, I have developed a passion for different
          sports entities around the world. My passions of written and video
          reporting have led me to a career in Media and Journalism . I
          currently work as a sports writer for The Daily Tar Heel and I have
          experience in sports broadcast control rooms. With my work at the DTH
          along with personal projects I have undertaken, I have gotten to to
          publish content in a while expanding my skills as a journalist.
