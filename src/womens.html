          UNC's Kalbas becomes fourth women's tennis coach ever to reach 700
          career wins

            When it comes to the North Carolina women's tennis team's history of
            success, it's hard to overlook one of its longtime constants — head
            coach Brian Kalbas.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sunday's 6-1 win against Boston College, Kalbas won his 700th game
            as a collegiate women's tennis head coach. He became the fourth
            Division I women's tennis coach — and only one of two currently
            active coaches — to reach 700 victories, further earning his place
            in the pantheon of UNC's all-time coaching greats.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a 17-0 record, UNC women's tennis has yet to be defeated this
            season. Last month, the No. 1 Tar Heels earned their third straight
            ITA National Team Indoor Championship.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sunday, though, the spotlight wasn't just set on that unbeatable
            roster, but also on the coach whose leadership has led to so many
            years of winning.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I've learned that when you have really good players, you win a lot
            of matches,” Kalbas said. “That's been what's been going on for us
            here at Carolina. We've had really good players, really good
            people.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Alle Sanford was in a tight third and final set in her court six
            match against Boston College's Stephanie Sanchez. Though Sanford
            lost the set, giving the Eagles their only point of the day, the
            energy the Tar Heels showed reflects the camaraderie that Kalbas
            consistently encourages among the team.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sanford's teammates cheered her on the entire time, just as they do
            for every match. When the chips are down, everyone on the team
            gathers around the court to provide their unrelenting support —
            Kalbas included.
          </p>
          <p>
            “We have such an environment that prioritizes enjoying the moment
            and enjoying the process,” senior Cameron Morra said. “And I think
            him getting to his 700th win today shows how much that can impact a
            team.”
          </p>
          <p>
            After thematch ended, the team donned shirts emblazoned with that
            inevitable number, 700, and picked up a full cooler of ice water,
            dousing their coach in a victory bath.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before arriving at UNC, Kalbas served as the head coach for William
            & Mary, where he recorded the first 214 wins of his head coaching
            career. Now, after 19 seasons at North Carolina, he's made it clear
            that his success isn't a coincidence.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the seniors to the first-years, the greatness was recognized.
          </p>
          <p>
            “He's just the best of the best," first-year Carson Tanguilig said.
            "It's hard to put it into words."
          </p>
          <p>
            This year, five of his players are within the top 30 ranked singles
            players in the nation. In his 30 years as a head coach for women's
            tennis, Kalbas said he has always credited his success to his
            players while also emphasizing the importance of team unity. The Tar
            Heels' strong mentality has given them the upper edge on multiple
            occasions this season. The team has dominated play from the start of
            the doubles matches, giving opponents no room for error later in the
            games.
          </p>
          <p>
            "We all make each other better," Morra said. "I'm really
            appreciative to be a part of that type of environment. Competing
            with these girls every day at practice and getting to play next to
            each other for Carolina is something super special."
          </p>
          Despite this season's constant triumphs, the team has no room to rest.
          North Carolina will be facing Miami and Florida State later this week
          in Florida. With just a few weeks remaining in the regular season, the
          Tar Heels must be prepared to face whoever crosses their path. And to
          hear Kalbas tell it, all he's looking at now is getting win number
          701.
          <p>
            “We feel like westill have room to improve as we're trying to figure
            out our outdoor identity,” he said.
