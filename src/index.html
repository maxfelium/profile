          My name is Max Feliu and I am a student at UNC-Chapel Hill, from
          Barcelona, Spain. I have lived in Spain, England, and in the United
          States before starting college. In my experiences in the different
          countries I have lived in, I have developed a passion for different
          sports entities around the world. From my home soccer team of FC
          Barcelona to UNC sports, my connection to these teams has made me
          become a Media and Journalism major and pursue a career as a
          journalist. I currently work as a sports writer for The Daily Tar
          Heel. With my work at the DTH, I get the opportunity to publish
          articles in a recognized newspaper while expanding my skills as a
          journalist. In the future, my dream is to return to my home country
          and report on sports in Spanish.
